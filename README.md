# PIP
__pip__ is a package manager for Python. That means itâ€™s a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library. The concept of a __package manager__ might be familiar to you if you are coming from other languages. __JavaScript__ uses __npm__ for package management, __Ruby__ uses __gem__, and __.NET__ use __NuGet__. In __Python__, __pip__ has become the __standard package manager__.
