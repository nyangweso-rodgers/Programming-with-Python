# Arrays

# Introduction to Arrays
* An __array__ is a data structure that contains a group of elements.  Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. In Python , __List__ is implemented as __Dynamic Array__ , In other languages like __JAVA__ and __C++__ we have __static__ array and __dynamic__ array. 

* __Static Array__: In case of __static array__ the size of array is fixed . So assume that you made a array with 5 as the capacity and you tried to add more that the capacity then it will through exception : Array Index Out of Order 

* __Dynamic Array__:  In case of __Dynamic array__ , for this you need not to specify any size here you can keep on adding elements.
