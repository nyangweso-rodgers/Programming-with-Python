# Lambda Expressions

# Remarks
* _you can only define fairly rudimentary functions with lambda. The return value from a lambda expression can only be one single expression. A lambda expression canâ€™t contain statements like assignment or return, nor can it contain control structures such as for, while, if, else, or def._

* _a function defined with def can effectively return multiple values. If a return statement in a function contains several comma-separated values, then Python packs them and returns them as a tuple:_
