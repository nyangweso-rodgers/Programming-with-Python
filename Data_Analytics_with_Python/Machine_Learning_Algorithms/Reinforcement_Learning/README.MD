# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Generally, RL is a ML method that helps an agent learn from experience. By recording actions and using trial-and-error approach in a set environment, RL can maximize a cumulative reward. You can use RL when you have little to no hiistorical data about a problem, because it doesn't need information in advance (unlike traditional ML methods).

In a RL framework, you learn from the data as you go. Not surprisingly, RL is especially successful with games, especially games of "perfect information" like chess and Go. with gamesm, feedback from the agent and the environment comes quickly, allowing the model to learn fast.

The downside of RL is that it can take a very long time to train if the problem is complex.
