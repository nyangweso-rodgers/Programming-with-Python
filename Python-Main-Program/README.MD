# main()

* In Python, defining a function called __main()__ is not a special keyword or reserved word. It is just a convention used by many Python programmers to indicate the entry point of a program.

* The __main()__ function typically contains the high-level logic of a program and is called when the program is executed. In many cases, the __main()__ function is included within the if __name__ == "__main__" block, so that it only gets executed when the program is run as the main program, and not when the file is imported as a module into another program.

* The __main()__ function can be defined anywhere in the file, and can have any name, but __main()__ is a common convention. The name of the function does not affect how the function is executed or its functionality, but it is important to use a name that makes sense and is descriptive of the function's purpose.

* In Python, when a Python script is executed, the interpreter sets the __name__ variable to "__main__", indicating that this is the main module being run. The if __name__ == "__main__" block is a way to separate the code that should be executed when the script is run as the main program from the code that should be used when the script is imported as a module into another program.


# name variable
* The __name__ variable is a built-in variable in Python that holds the name of the current module. When a Python script is run as the main program, the __name__ variable is set to "__main__". When the script is imported as a module into another program, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module.
