## Table Of Contents

# Overview of Programming Paradigms
* A __programming paradigm__ is an approach to solving a problem using some programming language. It is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. For __Python__, the following __paradigm__ exists:

# 1. Imperative
* It executes commands step-by-step, just like a series of verbal commands. Also called __stateful programming model__. 

# 2. Functional
* A functional programming paradigm is one in which everything is bound in a pure mathematical functions style. It uses the mathematical function and treats every statement as a functional expression as an expression is executed to produce a value.

# 3. Procedural
* It is a subtype of imperative programming in which statements are structured into procedures.

# 4. Object Oriented
* In the object-oriented programming paradigm, objects are the key elements of the paradigm. Objects can simply be defined as the instance of a class that contains both data members and the method functions.
