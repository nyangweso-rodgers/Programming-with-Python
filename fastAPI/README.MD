# Introduction
__FastAPI__ is a modern, fast and performance web framework for building API's with Python. __FastAPI__ supports __concurrency and coroutines__ without importing asyncio package.

__FastAPI__ is one of the _fastest Python frameworks_ available. Faster than __Express__ or __Nest JS__.

__FastAPI__ uses (__ASGI__),__Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface__ which is the standard interface between __FastAPI app__ and the __server__. __UVICORN__ is the fast ASGI server implementation. __ASGI__ helps enable an ecosystem of Python web frameworks that are highly competitive against __Node__ and __Go__.

# Features of FastAPI
* __OpenAPI for API creation__, including declarations of path operations, parameters, body requets e.t.c.,
* Automatic data model documentation with __JSON Schema__ (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema)
* __Automatic docs:__ Interactive API documentation.
* No new stntax to learn. Just standard modern Python.
