# Introduction to Control Structure in Python
__Algorithms__ require two important control structures: __iteration__ and __selection__. For __iteration__, Python provides a standard __while__ statement and a very powerful __for__ statement. A __while__ statement repeats a body of code as long as a condition is true.

# while Loops
The statement inside a __while__ loop is _repeatedly executed as long as the condition holds_.  Once it evaluates to False, the next section of the code is executed. 
The __break__ statement is used to end a while loop prematurely.

# for Loop
* the __for__ statement, can be used in conjuction with many of the Python collections. The __for__ statement can be used to iterate over the members of a collection, so long as the collection is a __sequence__

# if Statement
Python also has a single way selection construct, the __if__ statement. With this statement, __if the condition is true, an action is performed__. In the case where the condition is false, processing simply continues on to the next statement after the __if__ statement.

# List Comprehemsion
There is an alternative method for creating a list that uses __iteration__ and __selection__ constructs known as __list comprehension__ - it allows you to easily create a list based on some processing or selection criteria.
