# Definition
Solving a problem by creating objects is known as __Object-Oriented Programming__.

# Why Object Oriented Programming?
Because the concept of __OOP__ in Python focuses on creating reusable code, that means using the same code for similar tasks.

# Features of OOP
* __Inheritance__: creating new classes(known as a derived class) with an existing class with some additional features.
* __Encapsulation__: Using __encapsulation__, we can restrict access to methods and variables to prevent modification of data.
* __Polymorphism__:  ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types.

# Definitions of Terms Used in OOP
1. __Class__: __Class__ is a blueprint of an __object__. It contains all the details and methods of an object.
2. __Object__: An __object__ is an instance of a class. An __object__ has two _characteristics_:
    - __Attributes__: attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value
    - __Behavior__: behavior of an object is its predefined functions
3. __Methods__: are functions defined inside the body of a class, used to determine the behaviors of an object.
